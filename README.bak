Welcome to HardShell!

There's a few things I should mention before you continue:

It's reccommended you run this in unrestricted mode in powershell:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted


HardShell will create a HardShell folder into the temp folder in your main drive. 
You can change the location of this at line 88


Any line marked with "#<<" means that you can customize that output with the options given.
Like for example: "#<< Enable/Disable"

Any other line that you modify might break the code, so keep that in mind. I reccommend making a backup
of HardShell



Otherwise Enjoy!
